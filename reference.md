There are 22 characters in total. At any given time, the most that would be illuminated would be the phrase SHE / THEY / HE, which works out to 11. The smallest number would be HE / HIM, which works out to 6.
Now, having said that, I do like the idea of fading one phrase out while the other phrase fades in. In that case, the most characters lit at the same time would be a transition from THEY / HIM  (8) to SHE / HER (7). While that transition was taking place, THEY / THEM would go from bright to off over the period of, say 3 seconds, while SHE / HER would go from off to bright within the same time frame. Another scenario could be a transition from SHE / THEY / HIM to THEY / THEM in which case the THEY would remain bright (since it's part of both the phrase that is transitioning out, as well as the phrase that is transitioning in), while the SHE / and the HIM would dim, and the THEM would go from off to bright (again over 3 seconds).
